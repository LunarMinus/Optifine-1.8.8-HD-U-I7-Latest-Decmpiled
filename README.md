# Optifine-1.8.8-HD-U-I7-Latest-Decmpiled
Decompiled Latest 1.8.8 Optifine
This is made for 1.8.8 MCP.

Thanks to this video for showing me how to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unYOQlAZhTE&t=690s
And thanks to https://github.com/immibis/bearded-octo-nemesis for decompiling the source

(This works with shaders, and JavaSE 1.6 and 1.8)
